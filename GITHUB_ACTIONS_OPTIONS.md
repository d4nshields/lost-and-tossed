## 🔧 GitHub Actions Options

Your GitHub Actions are failing because they're trying to do complex builds that require Supabase credentials and full iOS setup. Here are your options:

### 📊 **Current Issues:**
- ❌ Code generation fails (missing Supabase env vars)
- ❌ iOS builds are complex and expensive (macOS runners)
- ❌ Integration tests try to launch simulators
- ❌ Flutter version might be outdated

### 🎯 **Option 1: Use Simplified CI (Recommended)**

I've created `simple_ci.yml` that only does:
- ✅ **Code formatting** checks
- ✅ **Static analysis** (dart analyze)
- ✅ **Unit tests** (flutter test)
- ✅ **Android APK build** (debug, no signing needed)

### 🎯 **Option 2: Remove All CI**

```bash
# Remove the workflows directory entirely
rm -rf .github/workflows/
git add .
git commit -m "Remove GitHub Actions (not needed for development)"
git push
```

### 🎯 **Option 3: Keep Full CI (Fix Later)**

You can disable the current CI and re-enable it later when you have:
- Supabase credentials as GitHub secrets
- Proper iOS certificates
- Complete test suite

### 🚀 **Recommended Action:**

**Replace the complex CI with the simple one:**

```bash
# Remove the old complex CI
rm .github/workflows/ci_cd.yml

# The new simple_ci.yml is already created
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify CI to basic checks only"
git push
```

### 💡 **Benefits of Simple CI:**
- ✅ **Actually works** (no missing dependencies)
- ✅ **Fast** (no iOS builds, no integration tests)
- ✅ **Useful** (catches formatting and analysis issues)
- ✅ **Free** (no expensive macOS runners)

### 🔮 **Later, When Ready:**
You can always add back:
- iOS builds (when you have certificates)
- Integration tests (when you have proper test setup)
- Release builds (when you have signing keys)

**My recommendation: Go with Option 1 (simplified CI) for now. It gives you the benefits of CI without the complexity.**
