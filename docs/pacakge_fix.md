## ðŸ”§ Package Dependency Fix

The `intl` package version conflict has been resolved by:

1. **Removing explicit intl dependency** - `flutter_localizations` automatically provides the correct version
2. **Using SDK-pinned version** - Flutter SDK controls `intl` at version 0.20.2

### âœ… Now Try:

```bash
cd /home/daniel/work/lost-and-tossed
flutter pub get
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Alternative Solutions (if still issues):

If you still get version conflicts, try:

```bash
# Option 1: Upgrade all packages to latest compatible versions
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions

# Option 2: Check Flutter version compatibility
flutter --version
flutter channel stable  # Switch to stable if on dev/beta

# Option 3: Clean and retry
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### ðŸ“‹ Current Package Status:

- âœ… **dart_geohash**: ^2.1.0 (Dart 3 compatible)
- âœ… **flutter_riverpod**: ^2.4.9
- âœ… **go_router**: ^12.1.3  
- âœ… **supabase_flutter**: ^2.3.4
- âœ… **intl**: Managed by flutter_localizations (0.20.2)

All packages are now Dart 3 compatible and actively maintained!
