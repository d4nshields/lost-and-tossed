## ðŸ”§ Complete Build Fixes Applied

Multiple issues have been resolved to get Lost & Tossed building successfully:

### âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

1. **Android Gradle Plugin** 8.1.4 â†’ 8.3.0 (removes warning)
2. **CardTheme API** â†’ CardThemeData (Material 3 compatibility)  
3. **Model Generation** â†’ Temporary simplified models without Freezed
4. **Enum Usage** â†’ Standard Dart enums instead of Freezed unions

### ðŸš€ **Now Try Building:**

```bash
cd /home/daniel/work/lost-and-tossed

# Clean everything
flutter clean
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/

# Get packages
flutter pub get

# Try building (should work now!)
flutter run lib/main_dev.dart
```

### ðŸ“‹ **What Was Changed:**

**Android Configuration:**
- âœ… Updated to Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.0
- âœ… Gradle wrapper configured properly

**Flutter Code:**
- âœ… CardTheme â†’ CardThemeData in theme files
- âœ… Simplified LostItem model (no Freezed dependency)
- âœ… Simplified AppUser model (no Freezed dependency)
- âœ… Simplified AppError model (no Freezed dependency)
- âœ… Standard enum usage in capture screen

**Models Are Now:**
- âœ… **Simple Dart classes** with manual JSON serialization
- âœ… **Standard enums** instead of Freezed unions
- âœ… **No code generation** required for initial build

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps After It Builds:**

Once the app builds successfully, you can optionally add back Freezed:

```bash
# After successful build, generate proper models
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

But for now, the simplified models will work perfectly for development and testing!

### ðŸ“± **Expected Result:**

The app should now build and run with:
- âœ… Working navigation between Explore/Capture/Profile screens
- âœ… Category selection in Capture screen
- âœ… All UI components rendering properly
- âœ… No more build errors

Try the build command above - it should work now! ðŸŽ‰
