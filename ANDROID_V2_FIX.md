## 🔧 Android v2 Embedding Fix Applied

The Android v1 embedding error has been fixed by creating a complete Android project structure with v2 embedding.

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

3. **Build files** with modern Gradle setup
4. **Resources** including themes, colors, and launch background
5. **Proper package structure** for the app

### 🚀 **Now Try Building:**

```bash
cd /home/daniel/work/lost-and-tossed

# Clean any old build artifacts
flutter clean

# Get packages
flutter pub get

# Generate code
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Try building for Android
flutter build apk --debug

# Or run directly on device
flutter run lib/main_dev.dart
```
